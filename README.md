# video-player
Plays videos with performance.

## Browser Support

Tested on IE11 but it should work IE10+.

## Installation

With npm

```
npm i video-player -S
```

You can download the latest version or checkout all the releases [here](https://github.com/hayatbiralem/video-player/releases).

## Usage

### Browser

You can import this plugin into your project as follows:

```html
<link href="path/to/video-player.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="path/to/video-player.js"></script>

<!-- Optional -->
<link href="path/to/vimeo-play.css" rel="stylesheet">
<link href="path/to/youtube-play.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

.. and you're ready to go.

### Webpack

If you want to import the plugin with your webpack build you can do it by:

```js
import "video-player";
```

You should look at `sass-loader` implementation on [webpack documentation](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/sass-loader/).

### Refresh

You can process new dynamic contents by calling:

```js
window.processVideoPlayer();
```

or in Webpack way:

```js
import processVideoPlayer from "video-player/src/js/utils/process";
processVideoPlayer();
```

Only new ones will be processed.

## Examples

By default video player object only contains scaffolding styles so we don't include any cosmetic styles in default but we prepared some for play icons.

```html
<div class="o-video-player" data-url="YOUTUBE_OR_VIMEO_URL">
  <div class="o-video-player__play">
    <!-- your play icon will be here -->
  </div>
</div>
```
